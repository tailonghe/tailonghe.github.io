I'm a postdoc researcher at University of Washington. My project focuses on the application of machine learning and data assimilation in climate change, air quality, and carbon cycle, including:

* Deep learning and other machine learning models.
* Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF).
* Four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) system.
