I am an atmospheric scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. My research interests focus on: 
* Where, when, and how air pollutants and greenhouse gases are emitted into the atmosphere 
* The impact of these emissions on atmospheric chemistry and the climate system 
* The variations in emissions and the underlying reasons for their occurrence 

I use observational data, physics-based models, and machine learning in my studies. Current research themes include the following:
* Detection of point sources of air pollutants and greenhouse gases from space-based and aircraft observations
* Development of efficient high-resolution inverse modelling of emissions
