I'm a 4th year PhD candidate in the Atmospheric Physics and Composition Modelling Group at University of Toronto. My project focuses on the development and implementation of advanced data assimilation systems in atmospheric science, including:

* Weak-constraint four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) systems.
* Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF).
* Convolutional and recurrent neural networks. Deep and reinforcement learning.
